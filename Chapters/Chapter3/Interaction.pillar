!!!Interaction

One major challenge is to design a business process engine that is loosy coupled with interactions solutions like web user interface.
The solution requires a loose coupling framework allowing to build simple interface with agents/users, being human or another system.
Annoucment seems  like an interesting framework to build on.
Ideally, there should be:
- web interfaces (forms frame)
- Desktop interface (SPEC, Brick)
- services/messages communication bus

Useful abstractions to achieve such generic interoperability are:
- message-based interaction
- and/or event-based interaction
- and/or service-based interaction

Need to abstract communcation for the differents agents.
